## End to End Machine Learning Project

This is a machine learning project that predicts students' performance based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, writing score, and reading score.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training using multiple machine learning models
- Prediction of student performance scores
- Web interface to input data and view predictions

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the model and web application.
- **Flask**: Framework used for creating the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating models.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
